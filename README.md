#  Bash Download Manager

This project is a command-line tool for downloading files from the internet using the Aria2c download utility. It allows the user to specify the number of downloads, the download directory, and the links to the files to download.

## Getting Started

To use this tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Make sure Aria2c is installed on your system
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory
4. Run the command `./index.sh` to start the tool

## Usage

The tool will guide you through the process of setting up your download. You will be prompted to enter the following information:

- The number of downloads you want to perform
- The download directory (you can leave this empty to use the default directory)
- Whether you want to create a new folder in the download directory
- The links to the files you want to download

Once you have entered all the information, the tool will download the files using Aria2c and record the download time. It will then display a summary of the downloaded files and the download time.
